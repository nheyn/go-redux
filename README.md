# Store
*A [redux](http://redux.js.org/) style store implemented in go.*

This project is base off of the [redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/CoreConcepts.html) written in javascript.
The api changes were done to make the working with the store more 'go'-like.

## Plans
- Add support for middleware (should be able to handle logging and history)
- Add examples
- Add benchmark tests
