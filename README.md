# Store
*A [redux](http://redux.js.org/) style store implemented in go.*

This project is base off of [redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/CoreConcepts.html) written in javascript.
The api changes were done to make the working with the Stores more 'go'-like.

## Plans
- Add examples for middleware (i.e. logging / history)
- Add error tests for middleware
- Add benchmark tests
